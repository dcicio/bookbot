Course 4 in boot.dev backend track -- building a bookbot

This is my first Real project. I'm following the backend developer learning track on boot.dev.

Goals of the project:
1. Configure a professional Python development environment on my computer
2. Deploy a Python project on my personal GitHub account
3. Learn how to use a professional code editor (VS Code)
4. Put my Python & Git skills to the test in a real project

When I get stuck:
1. Talk to Boots
2. Google. Start with official documentation and Stack Overflow
3. Boot.dev Discord (https://www.boot.dev/community)


BookBot is my first project!
